# GdiDataStructures
Collection of data structure implementations in csharp
You can either download the folder structure, and implement main methods yourself, or you can implement the packages listed below:
-package de.tbh.exampleImplementations.list;
-package de.tbh.exampleImplementations.queue;
-package de.tbh.exampleImplementations.sort;
-package de.tbh.exampleImplementations.stack;

With those packages implemented you can fiddle around with the classes yourself, you wont be able to edit them though.
